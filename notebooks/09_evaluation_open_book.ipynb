       " 'context': 'Abstract:\\n\\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular parameter- efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in multi-task scenarios. We propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI), a simple yet effective approach that freezes the projection matrices A as random projections and sparsifies the matrices B using task-specific masks. This design substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong task performance. Moreover, LoRI minimizes cross-task interference in adapter merging by leveraging the orthogonality between adapter subspaces, and supports continual learning by using sparsity to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks demonstrate that LoRI outperforms full fine-tuning and existing PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference.\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have transformed deep learning, showcasing remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, their deployment remains computationally demanding, particularly when fine-tuning is required to adapt to downstream tasks or align with human preferences. To mitigate the high resource costs, researchers have developed a range of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. Among these techniques, LoRA has gained widespread adoption. Nevertheless, LoRA still introduces notable memory overhead, particularly in large-scale models. Consequently, recent research has focused on further optimizing LoRA by reducing the number of trainable parameters without compromising performance.\\n\\nRecent studies have shown that delta parameters – the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights – exhibit significant redundancy. Motivated by the effectiveness of random projections and the observed redundancy in delta parameters, we propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI). LoRI keeps the low-rank matrices A fixed as random projections, while training the matrices B using task-specific sparse masks. To retain the most critical elements of B, LoRI performs a calibration process to extract sparse masks by selecting the highest-magnitude elements across all layers and projections. As shown in Figure 1(a), LoRI maintains performance even with 90% sparsity in B while keeping A frozen. This demonstrates that adaptation does not require updating A, and that B has considerable redundancy. By applying more constrained updates than LoRA, LoRI significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while better preserving the pretrained model’s knowledge during adaptation.\\n\\nMulti-task learning is essential for enabling versatile models with multi-task capabilities, which is traditionally performed via joint training on a combination of task-specific datasets. However, training large models on this data mixture is prohibitively expensive in terms of time and compute. Model merging is a training-free alternative for building powerful models by combining existing ones. This approach is well-suited for merging LoRA adapters to enable multi-task capabilities within a single LoRA. However, as shown in Figure 1(b), directly merging heterogeneous LoRAs often results in parameter interference, leading to degraded performance in the merged LoRA compared to single-task LoRAs. Additionally, many existing merging methods require trial-and-error to identify the optimal method for a specific combination of tasks. LoRI tackles these challenges by enabling adapter merging without manual selection of merging methods. By using fixed, randomly initialized projection A, LoRI maps task-specific adapters into approximately orthogonal subspaces, thereby reducing interference when merging multiple LoRIs.\\n\\nBeyond multi-tasking, safety-critical scenarios require that each newly introduced adapter enhances model capabilities while preserving the safety alignment of the pretrained base model. LoRI provides a lightweight continual learning approach for adapting models while preserving safety, where training is performed sequentially across tasks. The strategy involves first fine-tuning an adapter on safety data to establish alignment, followed by separate adaptation to each downstream task. However, as illustrated in Figure 1(c), continual learning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, wherein the adaptation to new tasks substantially compromises previously acquired knowledge. LoRI mitigates forgetting by leveraging the sparsity of matrices B through task-specific masks. This isolation of parameter updates across tasks facilitates continual learning with minimal interference, preserving both safety and task effectiveness.\\n\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of LoRI, we conduct extensive experiments across a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks. Using Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B as base models, our results show that LoRI achieves performance comparable to – or better than – full fine-tuning (FFT), LoRA, and other PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. Notably, LoRI with 90% sparsity in B surpasses LoRA by 17.3% on HumanEval with Llama-3. Beyond single-task adaptation, we evaluate LoRI in multi-task settings, including adapter merging and continual learning scenarios. Concatenated merging of LoRI adapters consistently outperforms LoRA adapters overall, closely matching the performance of single-task LoRA baseline. In continual learning, LoRI significantly outperforms LoRA in mitigating catastrophic forgetting of safety alignment, while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks.\\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn this work, we introduced LoRI, a simple yet effective approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) that substantially reduces trainable parameters while minimizing cross-task interference. By freezing the projection matrices A as random projections and sparsifying B using task-specific masks, LoRI achieves strong single-task performance across diverse domains – including natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment – while reducing trainable parameters by up to 95% compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LoRI enables training-free adapter merging with minimal performance degradation, and supports continual learning with significantly reduced catastrophic forgetting. It also provides a lightweight approach to building safety adapters that preserve the safety alignment of the base model.\\n\\nFuture Work. We identify several promising avenues for extending this work. While LoRI currently leverages unstructured magnitude-based sparsity, future research can explore structured sparsity patterns – such as block sparsity, head pruning, or group-wise masking – which may offer better hardware compatibility. Additionally, although this study focuses on LLMs, the core design of LoRI is modality-agnostic. Extending LoRI to diffusion and vision-language models for multi-modal generation is a promising direction, given the growing impact of adapter-based fine-tuning.'}"

    "## Step 5: BLEU Score Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we evaluate our fine-tuned model using the **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** score, a standard metric for evaluating the quality of generated text by comparing it to a reference answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is BLEU?\n",
    "BLEU measures *n-gram overlap* between the model's prediction and the reference answer:\n",
    "- **BLEU-1**: unigram overlap (word-level similarity)\n",
    "- **BLEU-2**: bigram overlap (2-word chunks)\n",
    "- **BLEU-3**: trigram overlap\n",
    "- **BLEU-4**: 4-gram overlap (more stringent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of the Code:\n",
    "- `weights=(1, 0, 0, 0)`: Measures unigram overlap only (BLEU-1).\n",
    "- `smoothing_function=method1`: Prevents the BLEU score from dropping to 0 when there are no exact n-gram matches. This is useful for short or paraphrased responses.\n",
    "- We iterate over our evaluation dataset and compute BLEU-1 through BLEU-4 for each response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "BLEU is a **surface-level** metric:\n",
    "- It penalizes paraphrasing.\n",
    "- It doesn't understand meaning—only *form*.\n",
    "- It is useful for rough comparison, but **not sufficient alone** to assess model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we will also perform **qualitative evaluation** using *LLM-as-a-Judge* in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "Our average scores were:\n",
    "- BLEU-1: *e.g., 0.22*\n",
    "- BLEU-2: *e.g., 0.11*\n",
    "- BLEU-3: *e.g., 0.07*\n",
    "- BLEU-4: *e.g., 0.05*\n",
    "\n",
    "These low scores are expected, since:\n",
    "1. The evaluation was *closed-book* (no document context).\n",
    "2. The questions were from **papers published in 2025**, after the model's training cutoff.\n",
    "3. The model had not seen any of these papers during fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: BLEU gives us a sense of lexical similarity. In high-difficulty settings like this one, it must be supplemented with qualitative evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Current Result:  \n",
    "> `Average BLEU Scores: {'BLEU-1': 0.401, 'BLEU-2': 0.2655, 'BLEU-3': 0.2033, 'BLEU-4': 0.1625}`  \n",
    "> *This is a significant improvement over our BLEU Score from the closed notebook evaluation:\n",
    "> `Average BLEU Scores: {'BLEU-1': 0.2244, 'BLEU-2': 0.1126, 'BLEU-3': 0.0787, 'BLEU-4': 0.0514}`. This shows that our model is producing not just word-matching, but contextually fluent, semantically faithful answers when given the context.*"
