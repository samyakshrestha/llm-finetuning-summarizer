       " {'question': 'How does LoRI reduce the number of trainable parameters compared to traditional LoRA?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'LoRI reduces the number of trainable parameters by keeping matrix A fixed as a random projection and sparsifying matrix B using task-specific masks, eliminating the need to train both matrices and reducing redundancy.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'Why is sparsity in matrix B important in LoRI?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Sparsity in matrix B enables LoRI to retain only the most critical elements necessary for adaptation, reducing parameter count and mitigating cross-task interference during adapter merging and continual learning.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'How does LoRI improve the process of merging adapters in multi-task scenarios?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'LoRI enables more effective adapter merging by using fixed, randomly initialized projection matrices A, which maps task-specific adapters into approximately orthogonal subspaces, thus reducing parameter interference.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'What mechanism does LoRI use to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'LoRI mitigates catastrophic forgetting by applying task-specific sparse masks to matrix B, which isolates parameter updates across tasks and preserves knowledge from previous adaptations, including safety alignment.'},\n",

       "  'answer': 'LoRI with 90% sparsity in B outperformed LoRA by 17.3% on the HumanEval benchmark using the Llama-3 model.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'How does LoRI compare to full fine-tuning and other PEFT methods in terms of performance and efficiency?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'LoRI matches or outperforms full fine-tuning and other PEFT methods across multiple domains while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA, demonstrating both high performance and high efficiency.'},\n",
       " {'question': \"What types of tasks were used to evaluate LoRI's effectiveness?\",\n",
       "  'answer': 'LoRI was evaluated on a diverse set of tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'What potential future directions do the authors propose for extending LoRI?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The authors suggest exploring structured sparsity patterns like block sparsity or head pruning and adapting LoRI to multi-modal models such as diffusion and vision-language systems.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'What is the broader significance of LoRI in the context of PEFT and LLM deployment?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'LoRI provides a lightweight, modular, and scalable solution for adapting LLMs with minimal overhead, making it particularly suited for multi-task learning, safety-critical alignment, and efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'What are the core limitations of traditional LoRA methods that ElaLoRA seeks to address?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'ElaLoRA addresses two key limitations of traditional LoRA: the fixed rank allocation across layers, which overlooks the layer-specific importance, and the inability to adapt ranks dynamically during training, which can lead to suboptimal parameter efficiency.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'Describe the three core components of the ElaLoRA framework.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"ElaLoRA's architecture consists of: (1) an SVD-based adaptation strategy for matrix decomposition, (2) an importance score calculation mechanism based on loss gradients to assess rank relevance, and (3) a dynamic rank learning algorithm that reallocates ranks periodically during training to optimize layer-wise adaptation.\"},\n",
       " {'question': 'How does ElaLoRAâ€™s adaptive strategy improve performance under limited parameter budgets?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'ElaLoRA reallocates computational resources to the most critical layers by pruning less important ranks and expanding ranks in essential layers, thus achieving higher performance even under smaller parameter budgetsâ€”for example, outperforming other PEFT methods with r=2 compared to their r=4 settings.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'In what way does ElaLoRA achieve better task alignment during fine-tuning?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'ElaLoRA uses gradient-derived importance scores to identify which layers contribute most to task-specific learning, allowing the model to allocate more capacity to those layers and thus improving task alignment and learning efficiency.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'What experimental evidence supports the superiority of ElaLoRA over other PEFT methods?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Experiments across NLU, NLG, and vision benchmarks show that ElaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in accuracy, particularly under constrained parameter budgets, and demonstrates better GLUE benchmark performance even with fewer trainable parameters.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'Why is ElaLoRA particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments?',\n",
       "  'answer': \"ElaLoRA's dynamic pruning and expansion mechanism ensures that only the most essential ranks are trained, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high performance, making it ideal for low-resource scenarios.\"},\n",
       " {'question': 'How does the final rank distribution in ElaLoRA reflect its adaptive learning process?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'ElaLoRAâ€™s final rank distribution reveals that higher ranks are allocated to layers deemed more important via importance scores, confirming that the model dynamically concentrates learning capacity on the most impactful parts of the network.'},\n",

    "## Step 6: BLEU Score Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we evaluate our fine-tuned model using the **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** score, a standard metric for evaluating the quality of generated text by comparing it to a reference answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is BLEU?\n",
    "BLEU measures *n-gram overlap* between the model's prediction and the reference answer:\n",
    "- **BLEU-1**: unigram overlap (word-level similarity)\n",
    "- **BLEU-2**: bigram overlap (2-word chunks)\n",
    "- **BLEU-3**: trigram overlap\n",
    "- **BLEU-4**: 4-gram overlap (more stringent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of the Code:\n",
    "- `weights=(1, 0, 0, 0)`: Measures unigram overlap only (BLEU-1).\n",
    "- `smoothing_function=method1`: Prevents the BLEU score from dropping to 0 when there are no exact n-gram matches. This is useful for short or paraphrased responses.\n",
    "- We iterate over our evaluation dataset and compute BLEU-1 through BLEU-4 for each response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "BLEU is a **surface-level** metric:\n",
    "- It penalizes paraphrasing.\n",
    "- It doesn't understand meaningâ€”only *form*.\n",
    "- It is useful for rough comparison, but **not sufficient alone** to assess model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we will also perform **qualitative evaluation** using *LLM-as-a-Judge* in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "Our average scores were:\n",
    "- BLEU-1: *e.g., 0.22*\n",
    "- BLEU-2: *e.g., 0.11*\n",
    "- BLEU-3: *e.g., 0.07*\n",
    "- BLEU-4: *e.g., 0.05*\n",
    "\n",
    "These low scores are expected, since:\n",
    "1. The evaluation was *closed-book* (no document context).\n",
    "2. The questions were from **papers published in 2025**, after the model's training cutoff.\n",
    "3. The model had not seen any of these papers during fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: BLEU gives us a sense of lexical similarity. In high-difficulty settings like this one, it must be supplemented with qualitative evaluation."

    "\n",
    "In this section, we use **GPT-4o**â€”a state-of-the-art model from OpenAIâ€”as a neutral third-party judge to evaluate the quality of our modelâ€™s predictions against ground truth answers. This is part of the **LLM-as-a-Judge** evaluation methodology, which is growing in popularity as a way to assess open-ended outputs where metrics like BLEU or ROUGE may fall short.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this section does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads model predictions from `eval_predictions.json`\n",
    "- Uses a GPT-4o prompt that provides:\n",

    "  - The reference (ground-truth) answer\n",
    "- Asks GPT-4o to score the generated answer on a **scale from 1 to 5**, considering relevance, correctness, completeness, and style\n",
    "- Stores all outputs in `gpt4o_judged_results.json` for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ask_gpt_judge()` â†’ Sends a prompt to GPT-4o via the OpenAI API and returns a numeric score\n",
    "- `judged_results` â†’ A list of evaluation records including the question, reference, model prediction, and GPT-4o's score\n",
    "- `np.mean()` â†’ Used at the end to compute the **average evaluation score** across all QA pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use GPT-4o?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because LLMs are best judged by **other LLMs** capable of contextual understanding. GPT-4o has been shown to be highly consistent and reliable in comparative evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation complements our BLEU score by offering a **semantic and qualitative assessment**, helping us better understand the strengths and weaknesses of our fine-tuned model.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Question: What are the broader implications of ElaLoRAâ€™s design for the future of fine-tuning large models?\n",
      " Reference Answer: ElaLoRAâ€™s design shows that adaptive, importance-based rank allocation can significantly improve parameter efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a paradigm shift toward more intelligent and resource-aware fine-tuning strategies.\n",

      " GPT-4o Evaluation: 2\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Question: How do the authors suggest future research should improve PEFT for fact embedding?\n",
      " Reference Answer: Future research should explore improvements in retrieval systems used by D-RAG, and consider more refined QA classification and data generation strategies.\n",
