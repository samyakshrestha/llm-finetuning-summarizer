    "# Baseline Model Evaluation (Open-Book)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates the performance of the **base Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3** model on a curated scientific QA task. The model was given **question + context** (abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the paper) at inference time, but **was not fine-tuned** on the QA dataset. This simulates an open-book setting using a pretrained instruction-tuned model.\n",

    "- Fine-tuning still leads to **consistent improvements across all metrics**, especially BLEU and BERTScore.\n",
    "- The narrow LLM-as-Judge score gap suggests that the base Mistral model is already competent in general QA, but **fine-tuning increases specificity and completeness**.\n",

    "## Step 5: BLEU Score Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we evaluate our fine-tuned model using the **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** score, a standard metric for evaluating the quality of generated text by comparing it to a reference answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is BLEU?\n",
    "BLEU measures *n-gram overlap* between the model's prediction and the reference answer:\n",
    "- **BLEU-1**: unigram overlap (word-level similarity)\n",
    "- **BLEU-2**: bigram overlap (2-word chunks)\n",
    "- **BLEU-3**: trigram overlap\n",
    "- **BLEU-4**: 4-gram overlap (more stringent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of the Code:\n",
    "- `weights=(1, 0, 0, 0)`: Measures unigram overlap only (BLEU-1).\n",
    "- `smoothing_function=method1`: Prevents the BLEU score from dropping to 0 when there are no exact n-gram matches. This is useful for short or paraphrased responses.\n",
    "- We iterate over our evaluation dataset and compute BLEU-1 through BLEU-4 for each response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "BLEU is a **surface-level** metric:\n",
    "- It penalizes paraphrasing.\n",
    "- It doesn't understand meaning—only *form*.\n",
    "- It is useful for rough comparison, but **not sufficient alone** to assess model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we will also perform **qualitative evaluation** using *LLM-as-a-Judge* in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "Our average scores were:\n",
    "- BLEU-1: *e.g., 0.22*\n",
    "- BLEU-2: *e.g., 0.11*\n",
    "- BLEU-3: *e.g., 0.07*\n",
    "- BLEU-4: *e.g., 0.05*\n",
    "\n",
    "These low scores are expected, since:\n",
    "1. The evaluation was *closed-book* (no document context).\n",
    "2. The questions were from **papers published in 2025**, after the model's training cutoff.\n",
    "3. The model had not seen any of these papers during fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: BLEU gives us a sense of lexical similarity. In high-difficulty settings like this one, it must be supplemented with qualitative evaluation."

    "In this section, we use **GPT-4o**—a state-of-the-art model from OpenAI—as a neutral third-party judge to evaluate the quality of our model’s predictions against ground truth answers. This is part of the **LLM-as-a-Judge** evaluation methodology, which is growing in popularity as a way to assess open-ended outputs where metrics like BLEU or ROUGE may fall short.\n",

    "**What this section does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads model predictions from `eval_openbook_predictions.json`\n",
    "- Uses a GPT-4o prompt that provides:\n",

    "  - The reference (ground-truth) answer\n",
    "- Asks GPT-4o to score the generated answer on a **scale from 1 to 5**, considering relevance, correctness, completeness, and style\n",
    "- Stores all outputs in `gpt4o_judgments_openbook.json` for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ask_gpt_judge()` → Sends a prompt to GPT-4o via the OpenAI API and returns a numeric score\n",
    "- `judged_results` → A list of evaluation records including the question, reference, model prediction, and GPT-4o's score\n",
    "- `np.mean()` → Used at the end to compute the **average evaluation score** across all QA pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use GPT-4o?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because LLMs are best judged by **other LLMs** capable of contextual understanding. GPT-4o has been shown to be highly consistent and reliable in comparative evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation complements our BLEU score by offering a **semantic and qualitative assessment**, helping us better understand the strengths and weaknesses of our fine-tuned model.\n",

      " Question: Why do the authors argue that PEFT may not be optimal for factual embedding?\n",
      " Reference Answer: The study shows that while PEFT is effective for instruction tuning, it struggles with embedding factual information as effectively, likely due to its limited parameter update scope.\n",
      " Model Prediction: The authors argue that PEFT may not be optimal for factual embedding because their experiments show that models trained on conceptual datasets significantly outperform those trained on factual datasets. This trend was consistently observed across all three proctor models, suggesting that PEFT may be more effective for instruction-based tasks rather than factual information embedding.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Question: What conclusions do the authors draw about the volume versus quality of QA data in PEFT?\n",
      " Reference Answer: They conclude that sheer quantity of QA pairs is insufficient; quality and conceptual depth are far more critical for successful PEFT.\n",
      " Model Prediction: The authors conclude that the quality of QA data is more important than the volume in PEFT. They suggest that carefully selecting and categorizing QA pairs can lead to more effective domain-specific applications of LLMs. They also propose that PEFT is particularly advantageous for instruction-based applications, even with a relatively small dataset. However, they also suggest that further research is needed to optimize synthetic data generation techniques like D-RAG for more comprehensive and complete answers.\n",
      " GPT-4o Evaluation: 3\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Question: What limitations of D-RAG were identified in the study?\n",
      " Reference Answer: D-RAG's limitations were attributed to the poor performance of its underlying vector database retriever, leading to suboptimal training data quality.\n",
      " Model Prediction: The limitations of D-RAG identified in the study were primarily due to the suboptimal performance of the vector database retriever. This inefficiency in retrieval impacted the overall effectiveness of the synthetic training data generation technique.\n",
      " GPT-4o Evaluation: 5\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Question: How do the authors suggest future research should improve PEFT for fact embedding?\n",
      " Reference Answer: Future research should explore improvements in retrieval systems used by D-RAG, and consider more refined QA classification and data generation strategies.\n",
      " Model Prediction: The authors suggest that future research should focus on improving the retrieval efficiency of the vector database retriever in the D-RAG technique for synthetic training data generation. This could unlock the full potential of D-RAG, leading to more effective and nuanced fine-tuning methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) in embedding factual information.\n",
      " GPT-4o Evaluation: 3\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Question: What is the key insight this paper contributes to the field of LLM fine-tuning?\n",
      " Reference Answer: The paper highlights that PEFT's success hinges more on dataset composition—especially the conceptual quality of QA pairs—than on volume alone, and that careful use-case targeting is essential.\n",
      " Model Prediction: The key insight this paper contributes to the field of LLM fine-tuning is the importance of categorizing question-answer (QA) pairs into ‘Factual’ and ‘Conceptual’ classes for effective domain adaptation. The paper demonstrates that models trained on conceptual datasets significantly outperform those trained on factual datasets, and suggests that PEFT may not be optimal for embedding factual information into LLMs. The paper also compares the efficiency of two synthetic fine-tuning dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive, with D-Naive demonstrating superior performance.\n",
