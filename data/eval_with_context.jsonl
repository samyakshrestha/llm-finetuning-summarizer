Motivated by the effectiveness of random projections and the observed redundancy in delta parameters, we propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI). LoRI keeps the low-rank matrices A fixed as random projections, while training the matrices B using task-specific sparse masks. To retain the most critical elements of B, LoRI performs a calibration process to extract sparse masks by selecting the highest-magnitude elements across all layers and projections. As shown in Figure 1(a), LoRI maintains performance even with 90% sparsity in B while keeping A frozen.

This approach is well-suited for merging LoRA adapters to enable multi-task capabilities within a single LoRA. However, as shown in Figure 1(b), directly merging heterogeneous LoRAs often results in parameter interference, leading to degraded performance in the merged LoRA compared to single-task LoRAs. Additionally, many existing merging methods require trial-and-error to identify the optimal method for a specific combination of tasks. LoRI tackles these challenges by enabling adapter merging without manual selection of merging methods. By using fixed, randomly initialized projection A, LoRI maps task-specific adapters into approximately orthogonal subspaces, thereby reducing interference when merging multiple LoRIs.\n\nBeyond multi-tasking, safety-critical scenarios require that each newly introduced adapter enhances model capabilities while preserving the safety alignment of the pretrained base model. LoRI provides a lightweight continual learning approach for adapting models while preserving safety, where training is performed sequentially across tasks. The strategy involves first fine-tuning an adapter on safety data to establish alignment, followed by separate adaptation to each downstream task. However, as illustrated in Figure 1(c), continual learning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, wherein the adaptation to new tasks substantially compromises previously acquired knowledge.

Motivated by the effectiveness of random projections and the observed redundancy in delta parameters, we propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI). LoRI keeps the low-rank matrices A fixed as random projections, while training the matrices B using task-specific sparse masks. To retain the most critical elements of B, LoRI performs a calibration process to extract sparse masks by selecting the highest-magnitude elements across all layers and projections. As shown in Figure 1(a), LoRI maintains performance even with 90% sparsity in B while keeping A frozen.

However, training large models on this data mixture is prohibitively expensive in terms of time and compute. Model merging is a training-free alternative for building powerful models by combining existing ones. This approach is well-suited for merging LoRA adapters to enable multi-task capabilities within a single LoRA. However, as shown in Figure 1(b), directly merging heterogeneous LoRAs often results in parameter interference, leading to degraded performance in the merged LoRA compared to single-task LoRAs. Additionally, many existing merging methods require trial-and-error to identify the optimal method for a specific combination of tasks. LoRI tackles these challenges by enabling adapter merging without manual selection of merging methods. By using fixed, randomly initialized projection A, LoRI maps task-specific adapters into approximately orthogonal subspaces, thereby reducing interference when merging multiple LoRIs.\n\nBeyond multi-tasking, safety-critical scenarios require that each newly introduced adapter enhances model capabilities while preserving the safety alignment of the pretrained base model. LoRI provides a lightweight continual learning approach for adapting models while preserving safety, where training is performed sequentially across tasks. The strategy involves first fine-tuning an adapter on safety data to establish alignment, followed by separate adaptation to each downstream task. However, as illustrated in Figure 1(c), continual learning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, wherein the adaptation to new tasks substantially compromises previously acquired knowledge. LoRI mitigates forgetting by leveraging the sparsity of matrices B through task-specific masks. This isolation of parameter updates across tasks facilitates continual learning with minimal interference, preserving both safety and task effectiveness.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of LoRI, we conduct extensive experiments across a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks. Using Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B as base models, our results show that LoRI achieves performance comparable to \u2013 or better than \u2013 full fine-tuning (FFT), LoRA, and other PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. Notably, LoRI with 90% sparsity in B surpasses LoRA by 17.3% on HumanEval with Llama-3. Beyond single-task adaptation, we evaluate LoRI in multi-task settings, including adapter merging and continual learning scenarios. Concatenated merging of LoRI adapters consistently outperforms LoRA adapters overall, closely matching the performance of single-task LoRA baseline.

{"question": "What are the core limitations of traditional LoRA methods that ElaLoRA seeks to address?", "answer": "ElaLoRA addresses two key limitations of traditional LoRA: the fixed rank allocation across layers, which overlooks the layer-specific importance, and the inability to adapt ranks dynamically during training, which can lead to suboptimal parameter efficiency.", "context": "Abstract: \nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models with minimal parameter updates. However, existing methods rely on fixed ranks or focus solely on either rank pruning or expansion, failing to adapt ranks dynamically to match the importance of different layers during training. In this work, we propose ElaLoRA, an adaptive low-rank adaptation framework that dynamically prunes and expands ranks based on gradient-derived importance scores. To the best of our knowledge, ElaLoRA is the first method that enables both rank pruning and expansion during fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ElaLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods across different parameter budgets. Furthermore, our studies validate that layers receiving higher rank allocations contribute more significantly to model performance, providing theoretical justification for our adaptive strategy. By introducing a principled and adaptive rank allocation mechanism, ElaLoRA offers a scalable and efficient fine-tuning solution, particularly suited for resource-constrained environments.\n\nIntroduction:\nScaling laws of transformer-based Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) suggest that increasing model size leads to improved generalization and task performance, which has driven the rapid expansion of model architectures, from 330M parameters in BERT to 1.5B in GPT-2, 175B in GPT-3, and 671B in DeepSeek, highlighting the trend toward ever-larger pretrained models. Despite these advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain constrained by their knowledge boundaries, requiring fine-tuning to specialize in domain-specific applications and adapt to evolving datasets. Traditionally, full fine-tuning has been the standard approach, which is nevertheless prohibitively expensive in terms of memory and computation.\n\nTo address the computational burden of full fine-tuning, Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) being a widely used approach that reduces trainable parameters without increasing inference latency.

Dynamic rank allocation methods like AdaLoRA and SaLoRA decompose a matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD) and selectively prune its singular values to control the rank of the matrix, but these methods are computationally inefficient as they begin with a high rank. IncreLoRA (Zhang et al., 2023a) mitigates this by starting with a minimal rank and increasing it heuristically. However, early training samples may not be effectively learned or utilized when the rank is small.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose ElaLoRA, a novel adaptive and dynamic LoRA framework that simultaneously prunes and expands ranks (as shown in Figure 1). By dynamically reallocating computational resources to the most critical layers, ElaLoRA ensures that essential layers receive more capacity while redundant ranks are removed. ElaLoRA operates through three key components: 1) SVD-based adaptation strategy; 2) importance score calculation to quantify the significance of each rank based on loss gradients; and 3) a dynamic rank learning algorithm that reallocates ranks at scheduled intervals. Experimental results across multiple Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Visual Task benchmarks demonstrate that ElaLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods under various parameter budgets. Notably, ElaLoRA achieves better average GLUE results with r = 2 than other PEFT methods at r = 4, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Comparisons are shown in Table 1.\n\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under different parameter budgets. Our results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of ElaLoRA, outperforming existing PEFT methods in performance.\n\n\u2022 We conduct analysis to verify that the layers and matrices identified as highly important for a specific task are indeed significant for that task, providing a principled validation of our adaptive rank allocation method.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this work, we introduced ElaLoRA, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that dynamically prunes and expands ranks based on importance scores, ensuring that the most impactful layers receive additional capacity while removing redundant ranks.

This misunderstanding may lead to the utilization of low-quality datasets, compromising the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a set of metrics to assess the quality and appropriateness of QA datasets for PEFT. We introduce a novel method for categorizing QA pairs into \u2018Factual\u2019 and \u2018Conceptual\u2019 classes using a BERT-based classifier.

Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of two synthetic dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive (depicted in Figure 1). Our results show that the D-Naive approach produces superior fine-tuning datasets compared to D-RAG. Additionally, we suggest that while PEFT is highly effective, it may not be optimal for embedding factual information into LLMs. Instead, it excels in instruction-based tasks.

Our study highlights the importance of QA pair categorization and synthetic dataset generation techniques in enhancing the performance of LLMs in specific domains.\n\nIntroduction:\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a highly effective strategy for refining Large Language Models (LLMs) on domain-specific data, thanks to its reduced computational and time requirements compared to full fine-tuning. This technique has seen widespread adoption in the industry for embedding domain knowledge into LLMs. Platforms like Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Mistral, AWS, and Lamini offer fine-tuning as a service using methods like Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), making PEFT accessible and user-friendly (Hu et al. 2021). These low code/no code solutions have become popular among developers due to their simplicity. However, the ease of use of these platforms can create a misconception that merely having a large quantity of question-answer (QA) pairs is sufficient for effective domain adaptation. This misunderstanding may lead to the utilization of low-quality datasets, compromising the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a set of metrics to assess the quality and appropriateness of QA datasets for PEFT. We introduce a novel method for categorizing QA pairs into \u2018Factual\u2019 and \u2018Conceptual\u2019 classes using a BERT-based classifier. By separating the original dataset based on these categories, we fine-tune two distinct sets of Llama-2 models using LoRA. Our evaluation, conducted with larger models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Prometheus, reveals that models trained on conceptual datasets significantly outperform those trained on factual datasets. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of two synthetic dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive (depicted in Figure 1). Our results show that the D-Naive approach produces superior fine-tuning datasets compared to D-RAG. Additionally, we suggest that while PEFT is highly effective, it may not be optimal for embedding factual information into LLMs. Instead, it excels in instruction-based tasks. To support our assertion, we conducted an experiment using a 1000-sample dataset for sales product recommendation in the data center domain. The results clearly demonstrate that the fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model outperforms the baseline model.\n\nConclusion:\nOur research highlights the paramount importance of the quality and categorization of QA pairs in PEFT, providing profound insights into optimizing the fine-tuning process of LLMs for domain-specific applications. The outcomes of our fine-tuning experiments reveal that PEFT is particularly advantageous for scenarios requiring minimal factual information embedding into LLMs. Notably, the LLM trained on a conceptual dataset significantly outperformed the one trained on a factual dataset. This trend was consistently observed across all three proctor models, underscoring that the sheer volume of QA pairs is insufficient for the effective deployment of PEFT in developing domain-specific QA bots. It is crucial to judiciously select the use-case when leveraging PEFT. Our product recommendation experiment further illustrates that for instruction-based applications, even a dataset as modest as 1,000 prompt-response pairs can yield a high-quality fine-tuned model.\n\nAlthough our experiments with D-RAG and D-Naive did not demonstrate that the D-RAG technique for synthetic training data generation is more efficient, we believe that this avenue warrants further exploration. The potential of D-RAG to generate more comprehensive and complete answers remains promising. In this particular instance, the technique\u2019s shortcomings were primarily due to the suboptimal performance of the vector database retriever. By addressing these retrieval inefficiencies, future research could unlock the full potential of D-RAG, thereby contributing to more effective and nuanced fine-tuning methodologies for LLMs. Thus, while current findings emphasize the importance of careful use-case selection and QA pair quality in PEFT, they also open the door for continued innovation in synthetic data generation techniques."}
