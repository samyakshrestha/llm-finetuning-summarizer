In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have transformed deep learning, showcasing remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, their deployment remains computationally demanding, particularly when fine-tuning is required to adapt to downstream tasks or align with human preferences. To mitigate the high resource costs, researchers have developed a range of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. Among these techniques, LoRA has gained widespread adoption. Nevertheless, LoRA still introduces notable memory overhead, particularly in large-scale models. Consequently, recent research has focused on further optimizing LoRA by reducing the number of trainable parameters without compromising performance.\n\nRecent studies have shown that delta parameters \u2013 the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights \u2013 exhibit significant redundancy. Motivated by the effectiveness of random projections and the observed redundancy in delta parameters, we propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI). LoRI keeps the low-rank matrices A fixed as random projections, while training the matrices B using task-specific sparse masks. To retain the most critical elements of B, LoRI performs a calibration process to extract sparse masks by selecting the highest-magnitude elements across all layers and projections. As shown in Figure 1(a), LoRI maintains performance even with 90% sparsity in B while keeping A frozen. This demonstrates that adaptation does not require updating A, and that B has considerable redundancy. By applying more constrained updates than LoRA, LoRI significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while better preserving the pretrained model\u2019s knowledge during adaptation.\n\nMulti-task learning is essential for enabling versatile models with multi-task capabilities, which is traditionally performed via joint training on a combination of task-specific datasets. However, training large models on this data mixture is prohibitively expensive in terms of time and compute. Model merging is a training-free alternative for building powerful models by combining existing ones. This approach is well-suited for merging LoRA adapters to enable multi-task capabilities within a single LoRA. However, as shown in Figure 1(b), directly merging heterogeneous LoRAs often results in parameter interference, leading to degraded performance in the merged LoRA compared to single-task LoRAs. Additionally, many existing merging methods require trial-and-error to identify the optimal method for a specific combination of tasks. LoRI tackles these challenges by enabling adapter merging without manual selection of merging methods. By using fixed, randomly initialized projection A, LoRI maps task-specific adapters into approximately orthogonal subspaces, thereby reducing interference when merging multiple LoRIs.\n\nBeyond multi-tasking, safety-critical scenarios require that each newly introduced adapter enhances model capabilities while preserving the safety alignment of the pretrained base model. LoRI provides a lightweight continual learning approach for adapting models while preserving safety, where training is performed sequentially across tasks. The strategy involves first fine-tuning an adapter on safety data to establish alignment, followed by separate adaptation to each downstream task. However, as illustrated in Figure 1(c), continual learning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, wherein the adaptation to new tasks substantially compromises previously acquired knowledge. LoRI mitigates forgetting by leveraging the sparsity of matrices B through task-specific masks. This isolation of parameter updates across tasks facilitates continual learning with minimal interference, preserving both safety and task effectiveness.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of LoRI, we conduct extensive experiments across a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks. Using Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B as base models, our results show that LoRI achieves performance comparable to \u2013 or better than \u2013 full fine-tuning (FFT), LoRA, and other PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. Notably, LoRI with 90% sparsity in B surpasses LoRA by 17.3% on HumanEval with Llama-3. Beyond single-task adaptation, we evaluate LoRI in multi-task settings, including adapter merging and continual learning scenarios. Concatenated merging of LoRI adapters consistently outperforms LoRA adapters overall, closely matching the performance of single-task LoRA baseline. In continual learning, LoRI significantly outperforms LoRA in mitigating catastrophic forgetting of safety alignment, while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this work, we introduced LoRI, a simple yet effective approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) that substantially reduces trainable parameters while minimizing cross-task interference.

    "context": "Abstract:\n\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular parameter- efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in multi-task scenarios.

In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have transformed deep learning, showcasing remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, their deployment remains computationally demanding, particularly when fine-tuning is required to adapt to downstream tasks or align with human preferences. To mitigate the high resource costs, researchers have developed a range of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. Among these techniques, LoRA has gained widespread adoption. Nevertheless, LoRA still introduces notable memory overhead, particularly in large-scale models. Consequently, recent research has focused on further optimizing LoRA by reducing the number of trainable parameters without compromising performance.\n\nRecent studies have shown that delta parameters \u2013 the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights \u2013 exhibit significant redundancy. Motivated by the effectiveness of random projections and the observed redundancy in delta parameters, we propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI). LoRI keeps the low-rank matrices A fixed as random projections, while training the matrices B using task-specific sparse masks. To retain the most critical elements of B, LoRI performs a calibration process to extract sparse masks by selecting the highest-magnitude elements across all layers and projections. As shown in Figure 1(a), LoRI maintains performance even with 90% sparsity in B while keeping A frozen. This demonstrates that adaptation does not require updating A, and that B has considerable redundancy. By applying more constrained updates than LoRA, LoRI significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while better preserving the pretrained model\u2019s knowledge during adaptation.\n\nMulti-task learning is essential for enabling versatile models with multi-task capabilities, which is traditionally performed via joint training on a combination of task-specific datasets. However, training large models on this data mixture is prohibitively expensive in terms of time and compute. Model merging is a training-free alternative for building powerful models by combining existing ones. This approach is well-suited for merging LoRA adapters to enable multi-task capabilities within a single LoRA. However, as shown in Figure 1(b), directly merging heterogeneous LoRAs often results in parameter interference, leading to degraded performance in the merged LoRA compared to single-task LoRAs. Additionally, many existing merging methods require trial-and-error to identify the optimal method for a specific combination of tasks. LoRI tackles these challenges by enabling adapter merging without manual selection of merging methods. By using fixed, randomly initialized projection A, LoRI maps task-specific adapters into approximately orthogonal subspaces, thereby reducing interference when merging multiple LoRIs.\n\nBeyond multi-tasking, safety-critical scenarios require that each newly introduced adapter enhances model capabilities while preserving the safety alignment of the pretrained base model. LoRI provides a lightweight continual learning approach for adapting models while preserving safety, where training is performed sequentially across tasks. The strategy involves first fine-tuning an adapter on safety data to establish alignment, followed by separate adaptation to each downstream task. However, as illustrated in Figure 1(c), continual learning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, wherein the adaptation to new tasks substantially compromises previously acquired knowledge. LoRI mitigates forgetting by leveraging the sparsity of matrices B through task-specific masks.

In this work, we propose ElaLoRA, an adaptive low-rank adaptation framework that dynamically prunes and expands ranks based on gradient-derived importance scores.

Dynamic rank allocation methods like AdaLoRA and SaLoRA decompose a matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD) and selectively prune its singular values to control the rank of the matrix, but these methods are computationally inefficient as they begin with a high rank.

This misunderstanding may lead to the utilization of low-quality datasets, compromising the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a set of metrics to assess the quality and appropriateness of QA datasets for PEFT. We introduce a novel method for categorizing QA pairs into \u2018Factual\u2019 and \u2018Conceptual\u2019 classes using a BERT-based classifier. By separating the original dataset based on these categories, we fine-tune two distinct sets of Llama-2 models using LoRA.

Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of two synthetic dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive (depicted in Figure 1). Our results show that the D-Naive approach produces superior fine-tuning datasets compared to D-RAG. Additionally, we suggest that while PEFT is highly effective, it may not be optimal for embedding factual information into LLMs. Instead, it excels in instruction-based tasks. To support our assertion, we conducted an experiment using a 1000-sample dataset for sales product recommendation in the data center domain.

This technique has seen widespread adoption in the industry for embedding domain knowledge into LLMs. Platforms like Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Mistral, AWS, and Lamini offer fine-tuning as a service using methods like Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), making PEFT accessible and user-friendly (Hu et al. 2021). These low code/no code solutions have become popular among developers due to their simplicity. However, the ease of use of these platforms can create a misconception that merely having a large quantity of question-answer (QA) pairs is sufficient for effective domain adaptation. This misunderstanding may lead to the utilization of low-quality datasets, compromising the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a set of metrics to assess the quality and appropriateness of QA datasets for PEFT. We introduce a novel method for categorizing QA pairs into \u2018Factual\u2019 and \u2018Conceptual\u2019 classes using a BERT-based classifier. By separating the original dataset based on these categories, we fine-tune two distinct sets of Llama-2 models using LoRA. Our evaluation, conducted with larger models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Prometheus, reveals that models trained on conceptual datasets significantly outperform those trained on factual datasets. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of two synthetic dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive (depicted in Figure 1). Our results show that the D-Naive approach produces superior fine-tuning datasets compared to D-RAG. Additionally, we suggest that while PEFT is highly effective, it may not be optimal for embedding factual information into LLMs. Instead, it excels in instruction-based tasks. To support our assertion, we conducted an experiment using a 1000-sample dataset for sales product recommendation in the data center domain. The results clearly demonstrate that the fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model outperforms the baseline model.\n\nConclusion:\nOur research highlights the paramount importance of the quality and categorization of QA pairs in PEFT, providing profound insights into optimizing the fine-tuning process of LLMs for domain-specific applications. The outcomes of our fine-tuning experiments reveal that PEFT is particularly advantageous for scenarios requiring minimal factual information embedding into LLMs. Notably, the LLM trained on a conceptual dataset significantly outperformed the one trained on a factual dataset. This trend was consistently observed across all three proctor models, underscoring that the sheer volume of QA pairs is insufficient for the effective deployment of PEFT in developing domain-specific QA bots. It is crucial to judiciously select the use-case when leveraging PEFT. Our product recommendation experiment further illustrates that for instruction-based applications, even a dataset as modest as 1,000 prompt-response pairs can yield a high-quality fine-tuned model.\n\nAlthough our experiments with D-RAG and D-Naive did not demonstrate that the D-RAG technique for synthetic training data generation is more efficient, we believe that this avenue warrants further exploration. The potential of D-RAG to generate more comprehensive and complete answers remains promising. In this particular instance, the technique\u2019s shortcomings were primarily due to the suboptimal performance of the vector database retriever. By addressing these retrieval inefficiencies, future research could unlock the full potential of D-RAG, thereby contributing to more effective and nuanced fine-tuning methodologies for LLMs. Thus, while current findings emphasize the importance of careful use-case selection and QA pair quality in PEFT, they also open the door for continued innovation in synthetic data generation techniques.",
